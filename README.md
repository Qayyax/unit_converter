# unit_converter
 
This is another mini project from the **Srimba Front-end Career path** program, which is about converting units based on an input. 

## What I learnt from this project 

- DOM Manipulation
- Using `eventListeners` in JavaScript
- Getting values from input with `.value` attribute
- Converting the input values to Numbers with the `Number()` function. 
  
   ```js
   button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  convert(Number(input.value));
   });
   ```


### What I need to work on

- I need to work on using relative units and not fixed units in my `CSS`, because I want to make my web apps responsive to different screen sizes.
